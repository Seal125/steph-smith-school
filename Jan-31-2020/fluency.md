1. Make a function, `doubled`, that takes in a list of numbers and returns a list of those numbers doubled.

2. Make a function, `positive_only`, that takes in a list of numbers (negative or positive) and returns a list of those numbers, all positive.

3. Make a function, `subtract`, that takes in a list of numbers and returns the result of all the numbers subtracted.

4. Make a function, `replace_vowels`, that takes in a string and returns the string with all the vowels replaced with whatever you'd like to replace them with.

5. Make a function, `shortest_word`, that takes in a list of words and returns the shortest word. Assume there **isn't any punctuation**, and assume that the list **only contains words**.

6. Create a function, `number_stylizer`, that takes in a list of contact dictionaries.

  ```
  contacts = [
  {name: 'Reuben', phoneNumber: '9196218777'},
  {name: 'Laisha', phoneNumber: '0123334766'},
  {name: 'Cielo', phoneNumber: '764'},
  {name: 'Maya', phoneNumber: '7653324599'}
];
  ```
  It should return a list of the phone numbers that are not only valid (meaning no more or less than 10 digits), but now with a new style. Here's an example:

  ```
  ['919-621-8777', '012-333-4766', '765-332-4599']
  ```
